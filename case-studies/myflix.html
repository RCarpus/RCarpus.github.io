      <h2 class="intro-header" id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
      <p>
        To create a full-stack web application using the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node) that allows users to
        create, read, update, and delete user data, and view information about different movies, genres, and directors.
        This application was built over one month as a part of CareerFoundry’s web development immersion course. </p>
      <h2 class="intro-header" id="the-process">
        The process
      </h2>
      <p>
        I built a back-end server using Mongo and Express with a RESTful API allowing users to create, update, read, and
        delete data. Then, I designed a client-side application using React with Redux that uses the API to view
        information about movies and update the user’s personal information.
      </p>
      <h2 class="intro-header" id="the-goal">
        The goal
      </h2>
      <p>
        A full-stack, responsive, and scalable web application demonstrating my both my back-end and front-end design
        capabilities that lets users view information about movies stored in the database and update their personal
        information.
      </p>

      <h2 class="myflix-h2">My development process</h2>
      <h3 class="myflix-h3">Backend (Mongo and Express)</h3>
      <h4 class="myflix-h4">Choosing a database</h4>
      <div class="case-study__floating-img-container">
        <img src="../img/myFlix/MongoDB_Logo.svg" id="mongo-img" class="float-left" alt="" />
        Choosing a database was a critical first step for building my API because the right choice for a database can
        make working with my data and developing my application much easier. I chose Mongo for a few reasons. For one,
        Mongo is very popular and well supported. If I ran into trouble, it would be easier to find solutions to my
        problem because of the large community of users. Secondly, because Mongo is a non-relational, no-SQL database,
        it is easily scalable, meaning that if I decide to update my application with additional movie info (like cast
        or music composers), I could do that with little trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hosted the database online using the MongoDB Atlas free tier service. The online client is easy to use, and
          it was easy to connect my application to the online database. If my app were to gain traction, I could also
          easily upgrade to a paid plan if I needed the additional storage space and features offered by the paid plans.
        </p>
      </div>


      <h4 class="myflix-h4">Choosing a hosting platform for my API</h3>
        <img src=" ../img/myflix/Heroku_logo.svg" id="heroku-img" class="float-left" alt="" />
        <p>
          Another important decision was how to host the server for my API. Thankfully, there are also some good free
          options available for this. For this application, I used Heroku to host my API. With Heroku, it is relatively
          easy to deploy new builds and view logs for troubleshooting purposes.
        </p>


        <h4 class="myflix-h4">Building the API endpoints</h3>
          <p>
            Before implementing any API endpoints, I needed to determine what I wanted a user to be able to do with the
            data. Keeping a list of every action that should be possible by a user of the API directly informed the API
            endpoints that would be created. For example, because a user should be able to view data about movies, there
            needed to be an endpoint that requested the movie data and returned it to the user. However, because I do
            not
            want users to modify the movie data by adding, deleting, or making changes to the movies, there is no
            endpoint
            allowing that sort of action to be taken. If new movies need to be added, that needs to be done directly
            within
            the database, which only I have access to do.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/myFlix/myFlix-documentation.png" id="myflix-docs-img"
            alt="A screenshot of the documentation for the 'Register a new user endpoint'" />
          <p>
            After documenting the necessary endpoints, I was ready to build them. I set up a server using Express and a
            few
            different libraries that would give me the functionality I needed without me having to do a lot of the work
            myself. Some of the key libraries used were mongoose, which allowed me to translate JavaScript into Mongo to
            communicate with the database, express-validator, which ensured that data sent to the server was formatted
            properly, and body-parser, which made it easy to work with JSON data in my requests and responses. After
            building my endpoints, all the required functionality of my API was in place.
          </p>

          <h4 class="myflix-h4">Authentication</h3>
            <p>
              Although my API was technically up and running at this point, I wanted to implement some security measures
              to
              make sure anonymous users were unable to use the API. To achieve this, I implemented http authorization
              using
              the passport library. This allows a user to log in and receive a JSON web token (JWT) which is stored in
              their
              browser. Each time the user makes a request to my API, a valid JWT is then required to have access to the
              endpoints. The only endpoint that does not require credentials is the registration endpoint. This is
              because if
              a user is not registered, they clearly do not have a valid JWT yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              It should be noted that although my API is somewhat secure using the JWT approach, I did not implement any
              further user permissions aside from the JWT. That means that technically, anybody with a JWT (which is
              anybody
              who decides to register) could proceed to delete and/or modify all the user data saved in the database,
              though
              the client-side app would not facilitate that behavior. If this were a commercial application, this would
              be
              considered a grave security flaw, but my purposes, I’ve achieved what I set out to do—allow users to login
              to
              their account.
            </p>

            <h3 class="myflix-h3">Front-end (React)</h3>
            <p>
              Having a working API was an accomplishment in itself, but without a well-designed user interface, who
              would be able to use it? Essentially, only developers would know how to access the data, and it wouldn’t
              be very fun. Therefore, I moved on to designing the client-side application that would interface with my
              API.
            </p>
            <h4 class="myflix-h4">Choosing the right framework</h4>
            <img src="../img/myFlix/React-icon.svg" id="react-img" class="float-right" alt="" />
            <p>
              Choosing a framework for my client-side application was crucial because it would dictate the way I write
              code for the entire project. React was a good choice because, like Mongo, it is well supported by a large
              community of users and is a tool that is highly in-demand. With React, I was able to divide each small bit
              of functionality into a component piece that could be used and reused wherever it was needed.
            </p>

            <h4 class="myflix-h4">Build tools</h4>
            <p>
              Due to the large number of files and imported packages in the project, it was necessary to use build tools
              to bundle and minify my code to reduce the file sizes sent to the client and help make the application
              work on all modern browsers. For this project, I used Parcel to handle my builds. With Parcel, I was able
              to have all of my React components transpiled in real time into code readable by all modern browsers,
              bundled into as few files as possible, and minified to reduce the file sizes.
            </p>

            <h4 class="myflix-h4">Application state management</h4>
            <p>
              As I was building the user interface, the component hierarchy became more and more complex, and it became
              cumbersome to manage the state of my application. I began encountering bugs caused by different components
              disagreeing on state values, and patching the bugs made the code harder to read and maintain.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/myFlix/myFlix-favorite.svg" id="myflix-favorite-movie-img" class="float-left"
              alt="Two screenshots showing the movie details view when the movie is a favorit and when it is not" />
            <p>
              For example, there is a star-shaped button on each movie’s details page that allows the user to add or
              remove the movie from the user’s list of favorite movies. This button was my kryptonite for a while. I
              could get the button to toggle the state of the favorite movie and successfully send the update to the
              server, but if I clicked away from the movie and then returned to it, the button would be in whatever
              state it was before I had clicked on it! This was very frustrating, as it seemed that the movie details
              view “forgot” that I had toggled the favorite status of the movie.
            </p>

            <p>
              I needed a state-management system that was more suited to my needs, where each component would get their
              state values from a single source, and no components could disagree on the state. That’s where Redux came
              in.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/myFlix/Redux_Logo.png" id="redux-img" alt="" />
            <p>
              Redux entered my application like a superhero. After a little bit of setup and refactoring of my code, I
              was bug-free, and my code was significantly easier to follow along with. Additionally, my code is now more
              scalable, and if I decide to add additional features later, I can do so with less fear of breaking other
              parts of my app. With Redux, my whole application’s state is stored in one Redux store, and when one
              component changes the state, all the other components that use the state immediately have access to the
              updated value.
            </p>

            <h4 class="myflix-h4">Data integrity</h4>
            <p>
              When working with forms, it’s important to perform client-side data validation to prevent the user from
              sending badly formatted data (or worse, malicious code) to the server. Technically, I do already have
              validation on the server side, so a user wouldn’t be able to send malicious code or bad data, but it would
              make for a poor user experience if I didn’t perform client-side checks as well. In this application, I
              chose to use the validation features built into React forms to check the data before sending it to the
              server. That way, the user is notified if they need to fix something before an API call is made, and the
              forms clearly communicate to the user what they need to fix.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/myFlix/myflix-bad-email.png" id="myflix-profile-img"
              alt="a screenshot showing a validation error when a user inputs an improperly formatted email address" />

            <h4 class="myflix-h4">Choosing a hosting platform for my client-side</h4>
            <img src="../img/myFlix/Netlify_logo.svg" id="netlify-img" class="float-left" alt="" />
            <p>
              There are several free options available for hosting websites, and for this client-side application, I
              chose Netlify to get some exposure to other hosting options. Netlify is pretty handy. I was able to set up
              automatic builds, so whenever I push new code to the main branch, the code will automatically bundle
              itself and deploy to the Netlify server. Having that in place makes it less of a chore to push through bug
              fixes and updates, giving me more time for what I want to be doing, which is developing the app!
            </p>

            <h2 class="myflix-h2">Retrospective</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of the MyFlix application was to create a full-stack web application using the MERN stack (Mongo,
              Express, React, Node) that allows users to create, read, update, and delete user data, and view
              information about different movies, genres, and directors. This was my first full-stack application, and I
              learned a ton of new things along the way. I can see there is a still quite a bit about security that I
              could learn if I want to take my API to the next level. A key improvement would be to allow users to
              modify only their own data instead of having full access to the API. I really enjoyed working with Redux.
              After wrapping my mind around how it works and getting it set up, it completely transformed my app by
              increasing the scalability and readability of the code.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project has been an excellent venture into the world of full stack development, and I am excited to
              continue working with more complex applications. I look forward to where my next projects might take me!
            </p>
