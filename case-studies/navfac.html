      <h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The calculation of axial load capacity for deep foundations is tedious to perform by hand, and layered soil
        profiles with varying parameters become nearly impossible to analyze without errors. The goal of this
        application is to automate the analysis of a suite of deep foundations with variable width and embedment depth
        for complex soil profiles.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-process">
        The process
      </h2>
      <p>
        I created a package of engineering functions to perform the axial load capacity analysis based on the NAVFAC
        methodology and wrote unit tests to ensure my functions work as expected. Then, I built and hosted a REST API
        with an Express server allowing users to create an account and save their projects. Finally, I designed a web
        application with React that consumes the API and my calculation package to perform engineering analyses and
        provide a detailed output of the calculations. </p>
      <h2 id="the-goal">
        The goal
      </h2>
      <p>
        A full-stack web application that simplifies and greatly accelerates the design of deep foundations for axial
        load capacity. Users are able to save and modify their projects, and they can download a detailed report
        containing the calculations for their suite of foundations. Whereas the analysis of a single foundation in a
        uniform soil could take 10 minutes to compute, my application enables the analysis of hundreds of foundations in
        a complex soil profile within seconds.
      </p>

      <h2 class="navfac-h2">My development process</h2>
      <p>
        The construction of this application was divided into three major parts which I’ll present in order. Ultimately,
        the process was iterative, but in general, my work was done in this order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The calculation package
        </li>
        <li>
          The API (Backend)
        </li>
        <li>
          The user application (Frontend)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="navfac-h3">The Calculation Package</h3>
      <p>
        Given that my goal was to calculate the axial capacity for a deep foundation, I obviously needed to implement
        the logic which would do that for me. The calculations are adapted from the NAVFAC Foundations & Earth
        Structures Design Manual 7.02, last edited September 1986. While the design manual seems old (and it is!), this
        methodology is still in common use by geotechnical engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this is a complex calculation with many steps, it was important to divide the work up into many smaller
        functions that perform tiny parts of the analysis. By doing that, I was able to write unit tests for each
        function that would ensure each step of the calculation was done correctly. Additionally, splitting the
        calculations into many smaller functions made it easier to read, understand, and document each function.
      </p>
      <p>
        So how did I go about planning out and writing my functions? In this case, I started at the end and worked
        backwards. The final result, the axial capacity, is the sum of the skin friction and the end bearing (You don’t
        need to understand what those terms mean). Ok, so how do I get the skin friction and end bearing? Well, the skin
        friction is the sum of the skin frictions for each layer in my soil profile. So how do I get the skin friction
        for a single layer? And how do I get the values required to perform THAT calculation? Following this trail all
        the way down eventually led me to the beginning of the calculation suite, which is where the user needs to input
        their project details.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/navfac/navfac_function_web.svg"
        alt="A diagram showing the interaction between some functions in the NAVFAC calculation package."
        id="navfac-function-web" />
      <p>
        After writing and testing each individual function, I needed some kind of interface that would take in the
        user’s project details and perform the relevant calculations with them. To that effect, I created a class called
        DeepFoundationAnalysis that would receive every detail regarding the soil conditions into its constructor and
        perform some initial calculations to process the soil data. A second class, called FoundationCalc, could receive
        the processed soil data from the DeepFoundationAnalysis along with some information about a specific foundation
        to be analyzed, perform the whole analysis, and save the calculation details in an object to be accessed later.
        With this infrastructure in place, the user could then call a function called analyze() within the
        DeepFoundationAnalysis instance that receives information about a suite of foundations to be analyzed. The
        analyze() function then creates a FoundationCalc for each combination of width and bearing depth specified by
        the user and stores the entire calculation suite in a property called calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially, the entire calculation package can be implemented into an application with a few lines of code:
      </p>
      <code>
        // Create an instance of DeepFoundationAnalysis with the required inputs<br>
        let myAnalysis = new DeepFoundationAnalysis(<br>
        &ensp;layerDepths, layerNames, layerUnitWeights, layerPhis, layerCohesions,<br>
        &ensp;groundwaterDepth, increment, ignoredDepth);<br>
        <br>
        // Call analyze() with the required inputs to create several instances of <br>
        // FoundationCalc behind the scenes and save results into myAnalysis<br>
        myAnalysis.analyze(material, pileType, widthArray,<br>
        &ensp;bearingDepthArray, FS, ignoredDepth);<br>
        <br>
        // Access the calculation results with the calculations parameter<br>
        console.log(myAnalysis.calculations.compressionAnalyses;<br>
        console.log(myAnalysis.calculations.tensionAnalyses;<br>
      </code>
      <img src="../img/navfac/navfac_class_interactions.svg"
        alt="A diagram showing the interactions between custom NAVFAC classes." id="navfac-class-web" />
      <p>
        With the calculation package out of the way, all I had left to do was to design and build an entire full stack
        application!
      </p>

      <h3 class="navfac-h3">The API (Backend)</h3>
      <p>
        For the backend, I chose to build an Express server and host it with Heroku for two main reasons—It works well,
        and It’s what I know. This API didn’t need any features that previous APIs I’ve built lacked. I just needed a
        collection of endpoints for reading, writing, updating, and deleting data associated with user accounts, and
        some simple security features to secure my users’ data. I’ve written about my process for creating an API with
        Express for previous projects, so I’ll just give a quick overview here.
      </p>
      <p>
        This API uses basic http authentication to log in a user. After logging in, the user gets a JSON Web Token (JWT)
        which must be included in the header of each subsequent request to verify the user’s identity. The JWT is
        encoded with a secret key, and the user ID encoded in the JWT must be that of the user the request is trying to
        access, otherwise the request will fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API is connected to a MongoDB server that stores information about the user and their projects. The
        calculated results are not stored on the server because that would eat up a lot of storage space, and the
        calculation runs quickly enough that it can easily be redone on the client side whenever they want to see the
        results. Instead, only the project data required to reproduce the calculation results is stored on the server,
        along with timestamps for the project creation date and the date the project was last modified.
      </p>

      <h3 class="navfac-h3">The User Application (Frontend)</h3>
      <p>
        The architecture for my frontend application was selected based on the same logic as my API. I built it with
        React because I am comfortable working with React. Routing is handled using hash routing with React Router DOM.
        I wanted the application to be as simple as possible to facilitate its one primary task—to perform foundation
        calculations. With that in mind, I created some simple views allowing users to register, login, create projects,
        and load existing projects to edit them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two most important views for this project are the interface for inputting project data and the results page
        which renders the results of the calculation.
      </p>

      <h4 class="navfac-h4">Project Edit View</h4>
      <p>
        If I wanted users to be successful with my application and enjoy using it, the project edit view needed to be as
        sleek and intuitive as possible. With that in mind, I split the window into two main sections, one for inputting
        soil data, and one for inputting foundation details. While there is no getting around the fact that the data
        input in inherently dense, I tried to use white space and padding effectively to prevent the user from feeling
        cramped or confused. To reduce clutter on the screen, the basic project info (Name, Client, Engineer, Notes) is
        hidden initially unless the user presses a button to show those fields. I did this because the basic project
        info is less likely to change between calculation runs, and it has no effect on the actual calculated output.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the individual data inputs, I tried to reduce confusion as much as possible by using dropdown selectors
        where possible and strategically placing written explanations of what is expected from the user. When the user
        is ready to analyze their project, they press the big blue button at the top of the screen. This triggers a
        comprehensive data validation that will inform the user if and where they need to fix their input parameters. If
        everything is in order, the user is redirected to the other most important view, the results view.
      </p>

      <h4 class="navfac-h4">Results View</h4>
      <p>
        The results view will typically render over 30 pages worth of html. In fact, the size of the output file will be
        proportional to the number of widths times the number of depths to analyze. Because of this, large projects can
        have hundreds of pages of output. Knowing that, the output was designed with printability in mind. In most
        cases, engineers won’t read anything beyond the initial summary pages, but they need to save their automated
        calculations for later reference or to be included in their project deliverables. To meet that need, the
        detailed output is designed to look nice when saved as a pdf. This is accomplished by setting the output width
        to 8 inches (The width of a typical sheet of paper) and setting print page break points strategically for
        readability.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/navfac/print_to_pdf.png" alt="Screenshot of the print preview for the results screen."
        id="print-preview" />

      <h4 class="navfac-h4">Other App Features</h4>
      <p>
        The application includes a few extra features that I hope are useful to for the users. For new users, there is
        an easily accessible link to a demonstration video that should teach them everything they need to know to get
        started with the app (except for teaching them how to engineer solutions)! Additionally, I included a button
        that would quickly take the user to the edit view of their most recent project. This way, they can quickly
        continue from where they left off if they need to tweak their previous design. Another cool feature is the
        ability to clone projects to keep similar versions of the same project without having to redo all of the data
        entry. My hope is that adding quality-of-life features like this will cause users to enjoy the experience of
        using the application, not just the time it saves. </p>

      <h4 class="navfac-h4">Responsiveness</h4>
      <p>
        Generally, I believe that responsive design plays a critical role in the effective of a website. In some ways, I
        believe that “If it doesn’t work on mobile, it doesn’t work”. However, I don’t believe that quite applies with
        this application.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/navfac/navfac-responsive.png" alt="screenshot showing responsiveness of edit view"
        class="float-right" id="navfac-responsive" />
      <p>
        Responsive design often equates to “Make the site look good on all screen sizes”. However, responsive design is
        really about understanding how users are using your application. For most websites, users are very likely to be
        accessing them from their cell phones, so working on all screen sizes really is an important goal. However, the
        users of this application are not casually browsing from their phones while they pretend to listen their spouse
        talk about their day. The users are engineers who are sitting at a desk and working on a computer. What does
        this mean for my responsive design?
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, the data displayed on the screen, by the nature of how data tables work, cannot fit onto a phone
        and still be readable. Horizontal scrolling is inevitable. However, it is possible that my users may have a
        split screen monitor with my application on only one side. Therefore, I did take care to make the views
        responsive to a certain point. The end result, in terms of responsiveness, is that most views work just fine on
        mobile, but the project edit and results view work best when the window is at least 830 pixels wide. For my
        users, this should not be a problem.
      </p>

      <h4 class="navfac-h4">State Management</h4>
      <p>
        For this application, I took a different approach to managing state than I have previously, but I kind of like
        the way it worked out. In this app, I made use of the browser’s localStorage to save the current project. This
        way, the user could navigate directly between views using URL endpoints like “/home” and “/analyze” without
        having to use React prop functions to pass the data around. Saving a few strategic things within localStorage
        allowed me to keep my components more loosely connected and less prone to bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the most part, most of my components didn’t need to share its state with anything else. The main thing that
        is passed around between components is a state value called isLoggedIn which tells the main app component
        whether or not to allow the user to access different views and what to render in the navbar component. I liked
        using this approach to state management for a somewhat small project such as this, but for larger projects, this
        may be better accomplished using Redux.
      </p>

      <h2 class="navfac-h2">Retrospective</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to create a full-stack web application that simplifies and greatly accelerates the
        design of deep foundations for axial load capacity. I’m happy to say that I achieved that goal in a very simple,
        easy-to-use way. I very much enjoyed applying my engineering knowledge to build a tool to help engineers, and I
        expect that I will create additional projects in the future that leverage my engineering and math skills into
        practical solutions for engineers.
