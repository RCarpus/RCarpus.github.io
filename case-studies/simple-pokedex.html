      <h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
      <p>
        To build a small web application that loads data about Pokémon from an external API called the pokéAPI, enables
        the user to view details about a selected Pokémon, and works on all modern browsers. This application was built
        in
        one week as a part of CareerFoundry’s web development immersion course.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-process">
        The process
      </h2>
      <p>
        The process used was to set up the page format in HTML, make an ajax fetch request to the pokéAPI to load some
        basic Pokémon data, then add a list of the fetched Pokémon names to the DOM using JavaScript. Then, I created an
        additional fetch request that triggers when the user clicks on a Pokémon name to get and display additional
        details in a pop-up modal.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-goal">
        The goal
      </h2>
      <p>
        A web app that provides users with Pokédex data about 151 Pokémon. The app displays nicely on all screen sizes,
        and on desktop, users can use the left and right arrow keys to scroll through the Pokémon list.
      </p>

      <h2 class="simple-pokedex-h3" class="simple-pokedex-h3">My development process</h2>
      <h3 class="simple-pokedex-h4">Fetching and Displaying Pokémon names</h3>
      <div class="case-study__floating-img-container">
        <img src="../img/pokedex/list.png" id="list-img" class="float-left" alt="A screenshot of the list of Pokémon" />
        <p class="case-study__inline-p">
          Finding an efficient way to display the Pokémon names was important to make the app code readable and
          scalable.
          I
          didn’t want to have to hard-code over 100 names into my HTML file! To make this work, I created a container
          div
          in
          my HTML. After making an initial fetch request to the pokéAPI, I used JavaScript’s DOM manipulation API to
          write the returned list of Pokémon names into an unordered list. This also returned URLs for each individual
          Pokémon to fetch additional details, which I used in my modal implementation. With this technique, I could
          manipulate the fetch request to the pokéAPI to return any number of Pokémon, and my list would still display
          properly.
        </p>
      </div>


      <h3 class="simple-pokedex-h4">Displaying the Details Modal</h3>
      <p>
        After clicking on the name of a Pokémon, I wanted the user to see a modal showing a picture and some additional
        details about the Pokémon. To simplify the implementation of the modal, I added Bootstrap to the project and
        used
        the customizable Bootstrap modal that would trigger whenever a user clicks on a Pokémon name. To populate the
        modal with additional details, I made an additional fetch request using the details URL provided for each
        Pokémon
        in the initial fetch request. The additional details I chose to include were the Pokémon’s type, height, weight,
        and sprite image.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/pokedex/modal.png" id="modal-img" alt="A screenshot of the details modal" />

      <h3 class="simple-pokedex-h4">Implementing Keyboard Controls</h3>
      <p>
        With the modal implementation complete, my app did everything it needed to do, but I wanted users to be able to
        quickly transition between details for different Pokémon. With the default modal implementation, a user would
        need
        to exit the modal and click on a different name to see a different Pokémon’s details. This makes for a clunky
        experience when a user is trying to compare two adjacent Pokémon, a common behavior when someone is interested
        in
        a Pokémon’s evolution chain. To facilitate this, I determined that left and right keyboard inputs would be an
        easy
        and intuitive way to browse through the Pokémon. </p>
      <p>
        To make keyboard inputs work, I needed to figure out how to tell my app which Pokémon to load next when clicking
        left or right on the keyboard. I determined that adding an ID to each Pokémon and adding it as a class to each
        list item could work. However, because a CSS class name cannot start with a digit, each list item got an
        ‘ID-[num]’ class that would need to be parsed before being used as an index in my JavaScript. The basic logic is
        that that when a user clicks a Pokémon, the app stores the ID in memory. When a user clicks left or right on the
        keyboard, the modal closes, the app looks for the Pokémon with the ID one above or below the previous Pokémon,
        and
        proceeds to load that Pokémon’s modal. The result is a very smooth desktop experience that encourages the user
        to
        explore the details of many different Pokémon. </p>

      <h3 class="simple-pokedex-h4">Cross-Browser Compatibility</h3>
      <p>
        Because this app needed to work on all modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 10, and I did not use a
        bundling framework such as Parcel to compile my code into something readable for all browsers, it was up to me
        to
        write code that could be properly interpreted by all browsers. I tested the app on my machine with Chrome,
        Firefox, Edge, and Internet Explorer. Additionally, I used an online service to test on Safari. The only browser
        that did not run the app properly was Internet Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        After digging into my code and referencing caniuse.com to find out what Internet Explorer is not capable of, I
        was
        able to quickly fix the problem by converting my JavaScript arrow functions to functions that used regular
        function syntax. This problem (and the fix) highlighted the need to pay close attention to what browsers I am
        building for to hopefully prevent these sorts of problems from occurring in the first place.

      <h2 class="simple-pokedex-h3" class="simple-pokedex-h3">Retrospective</h2>
      <p>
        The intent of this app was to build a small web application that loads data about Pokémon from an external API
        called the pokéAPI and enables the user to view details about a selected Pokémon and works on all modern
        browsers.
        This required me to think carefully about how I would format and load my data in an efficient way and to pay
        attention to the needs of the browsers that I was building for. </p>
      <p>
        This project does well what it was designed to do, but a few additional features could really improve the
        overall
        user experience. For example, the ability to load more Pokémon other than the first 151 and to search for
        Pokémon
        by name or type would help users to find the information they really wanted. This app could also be useful as a
        downloadable Progressive Web App where the user could have Pokémon data stored on their device and viewable even
        while offline. </p>
