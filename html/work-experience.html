            <h2>Staff Engineer: G2 Consulting Group</h2>
            <h3>May 2017 to Present</h3> 
            <p>
              After working a summer internship as a quality control field technician in 2017, I transitioned to a full-time role in January 2018 upon completion of both my Bachelor and Master of Science in Engineering degrees at the University of Michigan. I have served a variety of progressive roles here from providing field inspection services, laboratory testing, and detailed geotechnical analyses for projects ranging in scale from investigating the cause of excessive settlement in a local residential home to designing foundation elements for large scale solar power plants across the country. I also maintain our laboratory’s external quality control accreditation through AASHTO re:source, ensuring laboratory test results are performed consistently and correctly every time, regardless of which technician performed the work. <br/><br/>Working in consulting, I cultivated a client-centric mindset—that is, the client’s need is my need, and the client’s success is my success. I always strive to deliver the best of myself to my clients. That means producing high quality laboratory data, providing sound engineering judgement focusing on safety as well as the bottom line, and presenting a professional and confident attitude that keeps clients thinking of us for their future needs.</p>

          <h2>Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Engineering – University of Michigan</h2>
          <h3>January 2015 to December 2017</h3>
          <p>I transferred to the University of Michigan School of Engineering from my local community college after taking program prerequisite courses for a few years. I lived within commuting distance and was able to save money living in an apartment in a neighboring city with my wife who graciously worked to pay the bills while I studied. I was also able to take advantage of the Department’s Sequential Undergraduate/Graduate Studies program to earn my Master’s degree only one year after earning my Bachelor’s degree. The most important thing I learned in school is that with a problem-solving mindset, I can learn anything and do whatever I want to if I put in the required effort.</p>
