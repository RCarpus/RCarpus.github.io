          To create a progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique that
          accesses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events. This application was built over two weeks as a part
          of CareerFoundry’s web development immersion course.

          The process

        <p>
          My process was to write unit test and integration tests that were directly informed by the user stories, then
          write the necessary code to make the tests pass. Then I wrote acceptance tests to ensure that the required
          features work properly in my application. The resulting codebase is scalable and easier to debug due to the
          test-driven development process.

          To build a small web application that loads data about Pokémon from an external API called the pokéAPI,

          The process used was to set up the page format in HTML, make an ajax fetch request to the pokéAPI to load some
          basic Pokémon data, then add a list of the fetched Pokémon names to the DOM using JavaScript. Then, I created
          an additional fetch request that triggers when the user clicks on a Pokémon name to get and display additional
          details in a pop-up modal. </p>

        <p>
          To create a web-based calculator to easily compute the Terzaghi bearing capacity of any soil type for the
          design of shallow foundations. This is a common calculation used in geotechnical engineering and is
          straightforward to calculate once the design parameters are known, but prone to calculator errors due to the
          large number of variables and items to lookup. This app was designed to reduce calculation errors easily
          introduced by performing the work by hand. </p>
        <h3 class="intro-header the-process">
          The process
        </h3>
        <p>
          The process used to build the calculator was to create a JavaScript class called TerzaghiBearingCapacity with
          all the relevant design parameters and that has a function to calculate the bearing capacity using all of the
          design parameters. The user interface, built with React, works with a TerzaghiBearingCapacity class instance
          to calculate the bearing capacity for the soil type inputted by the user. </p>
