        <h4 class="intro-header the-challenge">The challenge</h4>
        <p>
          To create a progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique that
          accesses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events. This application was built over two weeks as a part
          of CareerFoundry’s web development immersion course.

        <h4 class="intro-header the-process">
          The process
        </h4>
        <p>
          My process was to write unit test and integration tests that were directly informed by the user stories, then
          write the necessary code to make the tests pass. Then I wrote acceptance tests to ensure that the required
          features work properly in my application. The resulting codebase is scalable and easier to debug due to the
          test-driven development process.

          A responsive web app that provides users with information about upcoming tech events around the world.
          Additionally, data visualizations inform the user about which cities have the most events and what types of
          events are the most popular.

          MyFlix is a full-stack application built using the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. Users
          of the app are able to register an account, view a database of movies, view and modify a list of
          favorite movies, update their personal information, and delete their accounts. Application state is
          handled using react-redux to promote one-directional flow of data and to promote scalability. On the
          server side, data is stored and retrieved in a Mongo database using Mongo DB Atlus. Logins are
          handled using basic html authentication, and subsequent requests are authenticated with a JSON web
          token. </p>

        <h4 class="intro-header the-challenge">The challenge</h4>
        <p>
          To build a small web application that loads data about Pokémon from an external API called the pokéAPI,
          enables the user to view details about a selected Pokémon, and works on all modern browsers. This application
          was built in one week as a part of CareerFoundry’s web development immersion course. </p>

          The process
        </h4>
        <p>
          The process used was to set up the page format in HTML, make an ajax fetch request to the pokéAPI to load some
          basic Pokémon data, then add a list of the fetched Pokémon names to the DOM using JavaScript. Then, I created
          an additional fetch request that triggers when the user clicks on a Pokémon name to get and display additional
          details in a pop-up modal. </p>

          The Terzaghi Bearing Capacity calculator is a tool used to compute the Terzaghi bearing capacity for
          a given soil and foundation type. This common calculation used in geotechnical engineering is
          straightforward to calculate once the design parameters are known, but is prone to calculator errors
          because of the amount of variables and items to lookup. This tool eliminates those errors and allows
          for quick and low effort sensitivity analysis.

          My Math Practice App is a single-page web application built using JavaScript with React, and

          problem set of basic arithmetic problems using various parameters to customize the difficulty level.
          After generating the problem set, the user submits their answers and receives a percentage grade,
          with each problem indicated as correct or incorrect.
