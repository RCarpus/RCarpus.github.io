          Healthy Eating Jumpstart is a collaborative program between two Michigan Medicine CQIs, Healthy Behavior 
          Optimization for Michigan (HBOM) and Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes (MCT2D). The program offers 
          food assistance resources for Type 2 Diabetes patients with food insecurity. The purpose of this website is 
          to provide low carb eating resources for participants in the Healthy Eat Jumpstart Program that also appeal 
          to health care providers or anybody interested in low carb dieting. </p>

          The process

        <p>
          Using Next.JS, I built an interactive, mobile-responsive website based on Figma designs created by the design 
          team. The website uses HBOM’s WordPress API to fetch low-carb recipes. Additional resources are drawn from 
          Contentful, the headless CMS used for MCT2D’s website. The website was initially built over a span of two 
          weeks and continues to receive periodic content updates. </p>

        <p>
          The website for Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes (MCT2D), which was originally built and hosted on
          SquareSpace, was riddled with visual bugs, had poor mobile responsiveness, had poor search functionality, and
          was unable to support the growing needs of custom features desired by the collaborative. The goal of this
          project was to clean up the layout, improve mobile responsiveness, improve page load times, and support
          additional functionality that would be difficult to achieve on SquareSpace. </p>
        <h3 class="intro-header the-process">
          The process
        </h3>
        <p>
          Using Contentful, a headless CMS platform, I migrated all existing content, including posts and hosted assets,
          from SquareSpace to Contentful. I used Next.JS, a popular React framework, to consume the Contentful API and
          build the website with scalability and performance in mind. Then, I added additional usability features, such
          as the ability to save bookmarks locally on a device. The project timeline included an approximately 3-month
          planning phase followed by a 3-month development phase. </p>

        <h3 class="intro-header the-challenge">The challenge</h3>
        <p>
          The calculation of axial load capacity for deep foundations is tedious to perform by hand, and layered soil
          profiles with varying parameters become nearly impossible to analyze without errors. The goal of this
          application is to automate the analysis of a suite of deep foundations with variable width and embedment depth
          for complex soil profiles. </p>
        <h3 class="intro-header the-process">
          The process
        </h3>
        <p>
          I created a package of engineering functions to perform the axial load capacity analysis based on the NAVFAC
          methodology and wrote unit tests to ensure my functions work as expected. Then, I built and hosted a REST API
          with an Express server allowing users to create an account and save their projects. Finally, I designed a web
          application with React that consumes the API and my calculation package to perform engineering analyses and
          provide a detailed output of the calculations. </p>
        <h3 class="intro-header the-goal">
          The goal
        </h3>
        <p>
          A full-stack web application that simplifies and greatly accelerates the design of deep foundations for axial
          load capacity. Users are able to save and modify their projects, and they can download a detailed report
          containing the calculations for their suite of foundations. Whereas the analysis of a single foundation in a
          uniform soil could take 10 minutes to compute, my application enables the analysis of hundreds of foundations
          in a complex soil profile within seconds. </p>

        <h3 class="intro-header the-challenge">The challenge</h3>
        <p>
          There are many ear training apps available for musicians to learn to hear the difference between different
          melodic intervals. However, there are no apps that train musicians to hear if a given interval is in tune or
          not. My goal was to create a web application to do just that—Let musicians practice hearing intervals that are
          slightly out of tune to sharpen their ears and improve their overall musicianship. This project was built over
          three weeks as a personal passion project.

        <h3 class="intro-header the-process">
          The process
        </h3>
        <p>
          Using JavaScript’s Web Audio API to generate tones, I built a full-stack web application using the MERN stack
          (Mongo, Express, Node, React) that generates customizable musical training sessions for the user and saves the
          results to the server.

          A gamified web application enabling musicians to sharpen their listening skills and track their performance
          over time with lessons tailored to the user’s needs.
