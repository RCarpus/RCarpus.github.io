          MyFlix is a full-stack application built using the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. Users
          of the app are able to register an account, view a database of movies, view and modify a list of
          favorite movies, update their personal information, and delete their accounts. Application state is
          handled using react-redux to promote one-directional flow of data and to promote scalability. On the
          server side, data is stored and retrieved in a Mongo database using Mongo DB Atlus. Logins are
          handled using basic html authentication, and subsequent requests are authenticated with a JSON web
          token. </p>

          This app fetches data from the pokeAPI <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank">https://pokeapi.co/</a>
          and displays a list of Pokemon that have been fetched.
          This Pokedex fetches data for the first 151 Pokemon (Generation 1). When the name of a pokemon is
          clicked, some additional details for the pokemon, including height, type, and a picture will be
          fetched from the API and displayed in a modal on the screen. The user can navigate back and forth
          through the different pokemon using the left and right arrow keys on a keyboard. The modal can be
          exited by pressing escape, clicking outside the model box, or clicking the close button on the
          modal.

          The Terzaghi Bearing Capacity calculator is a tool used to compute the Terzaghi bearing capacity for
          a given soil and foundation type. This common calculation used in geotechnical engineering is
          straightforward to calculate once the design parameters are known, but is prone to calculator errors
          because of the amount of variables and items to lookup. This tool eliminates those errors and allows
          for quick and low effort sensitivity analysis.

          My Math Practice App is a single-page web application built using JavaScript with React, and
          Bootstrap to help with format and styling. The application allows the user to generate a random
          problem set of basic arithmetic problems using various parameters to customize the difficulty level.
          After generating the problem set, the user submits their answers and receives a percentage grade,
          with each problem indicated as correct or incorrect.

          Meet app is React app coded using a test-driven development process. The app uses the Google Calendar API to
          fetch upcoming events from a a CareerFoundry events calendar.<br><br>

          To connect to the api, the app makes use of Amazon Web Service's Lambda service to perform authentication.
          Because this app is in test mode, a new user must have their gmail account added to my test users lists from
          my Google Console. If you would like to have access to the app, please reach out to me so I can grant you
          access. The new user will be redirected to the Google Oauth authentication screen where they must confirm that
          they want to give permissions to the Google Calendar API. Once permission is granted, the user is redirected
          to the application.<br><br>

          The app is a single page app with two inputs, one for a city name, and one for a number of events to show.
          Simply input your desired city and select it from the suggestions dropdown, then narrow down or increase the
          number of events shown with using the number input. Clicking on the "more details" button for an event will
          display a description and URL for the event.
