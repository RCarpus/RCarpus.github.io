      <h1 class="text-center">Hello. I'm Ryan Carpus.</h1> 
      <div class="row">
        <p>
          I am currently a geotechnical at G2 Consulting Group, in Ann Arbor, Michigan with over 3 years of experience performing geotechnical explorations for new commercial and developments, and for pavement and utility reconstruction and/or rehabilitation. In my short career, I’ve been involved with dozens of projects ranging in scale from investigating the cause of excessive settlement in a local residential home to designing foundation elements for large scale solar power plants across the country. However, led by my passion for computer programming, I am aspiring to take the next step of my career into the computer science field doing web development, software engineering, data analysis, or a similar programming role. <br/><br/>I believe that to achieve success on any given project, there must be a major focus on understanding the needs of the client and keeping in touch along the way to make sure those needs are met. When the client’s project is successful, we are successful. I also believe that members of a team are better together. We should constantly be learning from each other to deliver more effective products and to be more effective people. If you might be interested in having me on your team, please look at my resume and portfolio, and give me a call. I’m looking forward to joining a team that cares about the successes of their clients and strives to make a positive difference in the world.
